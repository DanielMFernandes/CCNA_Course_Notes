# 42. SSH (Secure Shell)

- By default, no password is needed to access the CLI of a Cisco IOS device via the console port
- You can configure a PASSWORD on the *console line*
    - A user will have to enter a password to access the CLI via the console port

- Alternatively, you can configure the console line to require users to login using one of the configured usernames on the device

LAYER 2 SWITCH MANAGEMENT IP

- LAYER 2 SWITCHES do not perform packet routing and build a routing table. They are **not** IP routing aware
- However, you can assign an IP address to an SVI to allow remote connections to the CLI of the switch (using Telnet or SSH)

TELNET

- TELNET (Teletype Network) is a protocol used to remotely acces the CLI of a remote host
- TELNET was developed in 1969
- TELNET has been largely replaced by SSH, which is more Secure
- TELNET sends data in PLAIN TEXT. NO ENCRYPTION

ðŸ’¡ TELNET SERVERS listen for TELNET traffic on TCP PORT 23

SSH

- SSH (Secure Shell) was developed in 1995 to replace less secure protocols, like telnet
- SSHv2, a major revision of SSHv1, was released in 2006
- If a device supports both v1 and v2, it is said to run â€˜version 1.99â€™
- Provides security features; such as data encryption and authentication

RSA KEYS

- To enable and use SSH, you must first generate an RSA PUBLIC and PRIVATE KEY PAIR
- The keys are used for data encryption/decryption, authentication, etc.
