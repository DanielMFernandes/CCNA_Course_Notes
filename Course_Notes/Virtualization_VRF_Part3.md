- VIRTUAL ROUTING AND FORWARDING (VRF) is used to divide a single router into multiple virtual routers
    - Similar to how VLANs are used to divide a single switch (LAN) into multiple virtual switches (VLANs)
- It does this by allowing a router to build multiple separate routing tables
    - Interfaces (LAYER 3 only) and routers are configured to be in a specific VRF (aka *VRF INSTANCE*)
    - Router interfaces, SVIs and routed ports on multilayer switches can be configured in a VRF
- Traffic in one VRF cannot be forwarded out of an interface in another VRF
    - As an exception, VRF LEAKING can be configured to allow traffic to pass between VRFs
- VRF is commonly used to facilitate MPLS (Multiple Protocol Label Switching)
    - The kind of VRF we are talking about is VRF-Lite (VRF without MPLS)
- VRF is commonly used by service providers to allow one device to carry traffic from multiple customers
    - Each CUSTOMERâ€™S traffic is isolated from the outside
    - CUSTOMER IP ADDRESSES can overlap without issue
