# 59-2. AI AND MACHINE LEARNING:

WHAT IS AI?

- Artificial intelligence (AI) uses computers to simulate intelligence, allowing them to exhibit behaviors typically associated with humans, such as recognizing patterns, learning, making decisions, and solving problems.

Some examples:

- Virtual assistants: Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant
  
- Recommendation systems: Netflix, YouTube, Amazon product recommendations
  
- Self-driving cars and robotics: Tesla FSD, Waymo
  
- Chatbots: ChatGPT, virtual concierges
  
- Game play and analysis: Stockfish (Chess), AlphaGo (Go)


- AI is growing in importance, driven by increased computing power, availability of big data, and breakthroughs in AI research (i.e., the AI boom since ChatGPTâ€™s release).

---

WHAT IS ML?
- Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling computers to learn from data and improve without the need for explicit programming.

- Instead of hard-coded instructions (programmed by a human), ML algorithms identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns.


IMAGEM


Some examples:
- Email spam filtering
- Personalized product recommendations
- Fraud detection (banking)
- Natural language processing (NLP)

  
-ML is the driving force behind many modern AI applications.

TYPES OF ML 

- Supervised learning
  - The model is trained on labeled data, where the correct answers are provided, to make predictions or classifications on new data.

- Unsupervised learning
  - The model is given unlabeled data and tasked with finding patterns, relationships, or groupings within the data.

- Reinforcement learning
  - The model learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions to maximize its performance over time.

- Deep learning
  - A specialized subset of ML that uses multi-layered neural networks to handle large datasets and perform complex tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.

---

SUPERVISED LEARNING

Supervised learning trains the model on a labeled dataset.

- Each input provided to the model for training has a corresponding label.

- By examining these labeled examples, the model learns the relationship between the data and the given label.

- By training on labeled examples, the model learns to classify new, unseen data with high accuracy.


IMAGEM


Advantages:

- Highly accurate when labeled data is available.

Disadvantages:

- Requires large, labeled datasets, which can be expensive and time-consuming to create.

- output is limited to the labels in the training data

---

UNSUPERVISED LEARNING

Unsupervised learning trains the model on an unlabeled dataset.

- No predefined labels are provided.

- The model can discover patterns, structures, or relationships within the data (without human supervision).
  - It groups (clusters) similar data points based on shared features.


Advantages:

- No need for labeled data.

- Reveals hidden patterns.

Disadvantages:

- Interpretation and labeling of the results is required.

- Less accurate.

---


REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

- Reinforcement learning trains a model by rewarding or penalizing its actions in a given environment to maximize its performance over time.
  - The model learns to take actions that achieve the highest reward or best outcome.

- How it works:
  - The model (called an agent) interacts with an environment.
  - It takes an action and receives feedback (reward or penalty).
  - Over time, it learns which actions lead to the best results.


- Applications include:

  - Self-driving cars: Learning how to navigate safely by trial and error.
  - Game AI: Mastering strategies in games like Chess, Go, or video games.
  - Robotics: Teaching robots how to walk, pick up objects, or perform tasks.


Advantages:

- Capable of learning complex behaviors.

- Adapts to dynamic environments.

Disadvantages:

- Resource intensive.

- Risk of suboptimal learning if the reward system isn't properly designed.

---

DEEP LEARNING

Deep learning uses artificial neural networks to process and learn from large and complex datasets.

An artificial neural network is a computational model inspired by how biological neural networks like the human brain process information.

Data is passed through multiple layers of nodes (neurons), with each layer extracting increasingly abstract features.

The neural network can be trained using supervised, unsupervised, and/or reinforcement methods.

Structure:

Input layer

Hidden layers

Output layer

Advantages:

Deep learning excels at handling large, unstructured datasets like images, audio, and text.

Achieves state-of-the-art performance in tasks like image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and more.

Disadvantages:

Resource intensive.

The model can be a "black box," making it difficult to interpret how it arrives at its decisions.
